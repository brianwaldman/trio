## Private Policy

I (Brian Waldman) made the mobile application Trio with absolutely no intention of collecting or profiting from personal information about its users (you). Any and all stored personal information (including usernames and scores) is pertanant and either kept locally on your device and removed upon Trio's deletion or on Apple's services (including iCloud and Game Center). Permissions for Trio to access and share information with these services that I do not own or control can be limited or denied through Apple's own Settings application.
